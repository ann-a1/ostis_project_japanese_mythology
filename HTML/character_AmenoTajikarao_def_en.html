At the event of Amano-Iwato, Ame-no-tajikarao waited at the caves' door to pull out (in the Nihon Shoki and the Kogo Shūi, 'to pull open') Amaterasu from the cave, and thus return light to the world.
During the Tenson kōrin, Amaterasu had Omoikane, Ame-no-tajikarao, and Ama-no-iwato-wake-no-kami accompany the Imperial Regalia of Japan when it went to the Ise province to be enshrined at Ise Grand Shrine.
In the genealogy of Mochizuki clan, he is the grandson of deity Kamimusubi and the ancestor of a clan of the ancient kingdom of Ki-no-kuni-miyatsuko, which is modern-day Wakayama Prefecture, which in the Shinsen Shōjiroku.
However, in another genealogical text, Ame-no-Tajikarao appears to be the child of Ame-Yagokoro-Omoikane-no-mikoto - another name of the deity Omoikane, which is the honored distant ancestor of the Achinohōri clan. Although in relation to this clan, inscribed in another text, the child of the deity Omoikane, Ame-no-Uwaharu-no-mikoto, the name of Ame-no-Tajikarao is no where to be seen in the genealogy tree.
His own Shinto priests think he was originally a protector of agriculture (maybe because he brought back sun light to the world, or maybe because peasants need fitness to work in the fields). Strangely, this god is often in association with Sugawara no Michizane, as the god Tenjin.
