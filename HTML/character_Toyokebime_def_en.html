Toyouke-Ōmikami is the goddess of agriculture and industry in the Shinto religion. Originally enshrined in the Tanba region of Japan, she was called to reside at Gekū, Ise Shrine, about 1,500 years ago at the age of Emperor Yūryaku to offer sacred food to Amaterasu Ōmikami, the Sun Goddess.
Toyouke-Ōmikami is a granddaughter to Izanagi by her father Wakumusubi, who was born while Izanami was still alive (based on Kojiki).
While popular as Toyouke-Ōhmikami presently, her name has been transcribed using Chinese characters in several manners including Toyouke bime no kami in "Kojiki", while there is no entry about her in "Nihon Shoki". Literally, her name means kami of "Luxuriant-food Princess".

Several alternative transcription and names are attributed to this goddess including Toyoukebime no kami, Toyuuke no kami, Toyouka no Menokami, Toyuke no Ōkami, and Toyohirume. God and goddess thought to be identical to Toyouke-Ōhmikami are a god Ōmonoimi-no-kami and a goddess Toyooka hime
