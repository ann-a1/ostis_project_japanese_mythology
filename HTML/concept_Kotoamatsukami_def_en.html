Kotoamatsukami is the collective name for the first gods which came into existence at the time of the creation of the universe. They were born in Takamagahara, the world of Heaven at the time of the creation. Unlike the later gods, these deities were born without any procreation.

The three deities that first appeared were:

    Amenominakanushi - Central Master
    Takamimusubi - High Creator
    Kamimusubi - Divine Creator

A bit later, two more deities came into existence:

    Umashi'ashikabihikoji - Energy
    Amenotokotachi - Heaven
